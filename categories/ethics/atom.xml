    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cecil_Martin">Uncle Bob</a> recently published a <a href="http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2015/11/18/TheProgrammersOath.html">post</a> where he
attempted to formulate the ethical principles that should guide programmers.  It
was an interesting concept, but I immediately felt it could use a rewrite.</p>

<p>Although I agree that everything in his version is a good idea, I disagree with
the formulation as an ethical guideline for programmers.  Simply put, the
principles of Agile are brilliant.  But they hardly deserve mention in a list of
ethics, and &ndash; I would contend &ndash; detract from the list.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>There are most certainly cases where following Agile practices would be the
unethical thing to do; it all depends on the needs and policies of the client or
company.  For example, consider Principle 5:</p>

<blockquote><p>I will fearlessly and relentlessly improve the code at every opportunity. I
will never make the code worse.</p></blockquote>

<p>Sometimes, what&rsquo;s needed is a quick fix for production, followed by a more
well-thought-out solution that will take some time to produce.  Will that make
the code worse in the meantime?  You betcha.  Is it the right thing to do
anyway?  Very likely.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s consider Principle 7:</p>

<blockquote><p>I will continuously ensure that others can cover for me, and that I can cover
for them.</p></blockquote>

<p>Again, I totally agree.  But if there are 2 developers in a tiny, bootstrapped
startup, maybe you don&rsquo;t have enough time to share all the information all the
time.  Principle 7 is true for most business cases.  But as soon as it&rsquo;s
specific to a business case, you can tell that this is less of a moral principle
and more of a strategy for success in accomplishing something else.</p>

<p>In both cases, the principles are really ways of &ndash; in the average business case
&ndash; helping the employer/client to be more stable and able to continually improve
its product.  So when it comes to the ethical piece, these principles &ndash; in fact,
at least half of the oath &ndash; boils down to:</p>

<blockquote><p>I will be an honest employee or contract worker, making sincere effort to
produce value for those who pay the bills, in both the short and long term.</p></blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s a statement of ethics, and it might belong in a programmer&rsquo;s oath.</p>

<p>Thinking about it further, I came up with my own version of the programmer&rsquo;s
oath, heavily based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hippocratic_Oath&amp;oldid=688739951#Modern_version">version</a> of the Hippocratic
Oath currently used in many medical schools.  I was honestly surprised at how
much could be lightly edited and incorporated into a programmer&rsquo;s oath.  There
is a comforting universality to ethics.</p>

<p>Let me know your thoughts!</p>

<blockquote><p>I swear to fulfill, to the best of my ability and judgment, this covenant:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I appreciate the work of past generations, who overcame hardware and software limitations to produce the programming environment of today, and I will collaborate with colleagues in the present to further improve the future of our trade.  I recognize that I have received instruction from those who preceded me, and I will repay in kind by sharing my knowledge with those who will follow.</p></li>
<li><p>I will strive to efficiently produce the solution which best fits the needs as best as I can perceive them.  I will not shortchange through either overengineering or underdesigning.  I will provide verification, to whatever degree is reasonable given constraints of time and finances, that the solution I have generated works as expected.</p></li>
<li><p>I will treat clients and coworkers with respect and warmth.  I will listen to their ideas, using their input to sharpen my own understanding.  When disagreement arises, I will collaborate with the other parties to reach mutual understanding and agreement.  I will never reject or insult anyone I work with.</p></li>
<li><p>I will not be afraid to say &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&rdquo; and I will respect others for their admission of the same.  I will not be afraid to ask questions.</p></li>
<li><p>I will never attempt to deceive those who rely on my honesty.</p></li>
<li><p>I will respect the privacy of my company and/or clients, barring unethical or illegal behavior on their part.</p></li>
<li><p>I take full and complete responsibility for the ethical implications of every line of code I write.  I will value the guidance of my own moral conscience above my company&rsquo;s or client&rsquo;s desire for profit.</p></li>
<li><p>I will remember at all times that all of my code will interact with people; it will influence the lives of human beings.</p></li>
<li><p>When the problem is people, rather than code, I will address the people problem directly, rather than incurring the technical debt of excess code.</p></li>
<li><p>I will always consider myself a regular member of society with access to extra information and power.  My skills give me no right to exert greater influence on other human beings.</p></li>
</ol>
