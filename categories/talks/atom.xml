<h4>Talk Description:</h4>

<p>Ugh, documentation.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the afterthought of every system, scrambled together in the final days
before launch, updated sparingly, generally out of date.</p>

<p>What if we could programmatically verify that our API documentation was
accurate? What if this helped us build more intuitive APIs by putting our users
first? What if documentation came first, and helped us write our code?</p>

<p>With Swagger and Apivore as our weapons of choice, we&rsquo;ll write documentation
that will make your APIs better, your clients more satisfied, and you happier.</p>

the real thing, here&rsquo;s the video:</p>

<h4>Talk Description:</h4>

<p>You care deeply about code quality and constantly strive to learn more. You
devour books and blogs, watch conference talks, and practice code katas.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s excellent! But immaculately factored code and clean architecture alone
won&rsquo;t guarantee quality software.</p>

<p>As a developer, your job isn&rsquo;t to write Good Code. It&rsquo;s to deliver value for
people. In that light, we&rsquo;ll examine the effects of a host of popular coding
practices. What do they accomplish? Where do they fall short?</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ll set meaningful goals for well-rounded, high-quality software that solves
important problems for real people.</p>

<h4>Exercise from the talk:</h4>

<p>Download the exercise as a <a href="/assets/railsconf-2017/exercise.pdf">PDF</a>,
<a href="/assets/railsconf-2017/exercise.key">Keynote</a>, or
<a href="/assets/railsconf-2017/exercise.pptx">PowerPoint</a> file.</p>

<h4>Talk Errata:</h4>

<p>Reflecting afterwards, I noticed a few mistakes I made in the presentation, and
would like to note them here:</p>

<ol>
<li>I confused <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity">Cyclomatic Complexity</a>
with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_score">ABC (Assignments, Branching, and Conditionals)</a>
metric.  Branching is very similar to cyclomatic complexity, but technically
<a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?AbcMetric">ABC is a software size metric, not a complexity metric</a>,
and it encompasses more than cyclomatic complexity.</li>
<li>I mentioned <a href="http://ruby.sadi.st/Flay.html">Flay</a> when I had intended to
reference <a href="http://ruby.sadi.st/Flog.html">Flog</a>; the former is a tool for
locating duplication, while the latter is actually a measure of ABC in Ruby.</li>
<li>Code Review is generally done after checking code into source control; the
intention was that it&rsquo;s done before code is moved into the main (master) branch
of a central repository.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Talk Description:</h4>

<p>OpenStruct, part of Ruby&rsquo;s standard library, is prized for its beautiful API. It provides dynamic data objects with automatically generated getters and setters. Unfortunately, OpenStruct also carries a hefty performance penalty.</p>

<p>Luckily, Rubyists have recently improved OpenStruct performance and provided some alternatives. We&rsquo;ll study their approaches, learning to take advantage of the tools in our ecosystem while advancing the state our community.</p>

<p>Sometimes, we can have our cake and eat it too. But it takes creativity, hard work, and willingness to question why things are the way they are.</p>

<h4>Talk Description:</h4>

<p>OpenStruct, part of Rubyâ€™s standard library, is prized for its beautiful API. It provides dynamic data objects with automatically generated getters and setters. Unfortunately, OpenStruct also carries a hefty performance penalty.</p>

<p>Recently, Rubyists have tried various approaches to speed up OpenStruct or provide alternatives. We will study these attempts, learning how to take advantage of the tools in our ecosystem while advancing the state of the Ruby community.</p>

<p>Sometimes, we can have our cake and eat it too. But it takes creativity, hard work, and willingness to question why things are the way they are.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This isn&rsquo;t technically a conference talk, just something I prepared for a lightning talk at RailsConf 2016.  Didn&rsquo;t end up giving the talk (they always sign up more people than they have time for), but this was so much fun I decided to make a 5-minute video and put it up online.  Enjoy!</p>
