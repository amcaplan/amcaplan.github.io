<p>You have feature flags in your application, letting you turn off calls to
external services as necessary.  How can we make this happen automatically?</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Degrade: An Amputation Tool</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/jamesgolick/degrade">Degrade</a> exists to cut off error-prone external services when they
fail.  Let&rsquo;s go through a demo of how we might use it.</p>

<p>Before starting, we should note that redis is absolutely required to use
degrade.</p>

<h3>Install the gem</h3>

<p>First, <code>gem install degrade</code> or add <code>gem "degrade"</code> to your Gemfile and <code>bundle
install</code>.</p>

<h3>Instantiate the <code>degrade</code> object</h3>

<p>Next, assuming you have a <code>redis</code> variable which is an instance of
<a href="https://github.com/redis/redis-rb">Redis</a>:</p>

<p>``` ruby
degrade_my_feature = Degrade.new(
  redis,
  name:             :my_feature,
  sample:           5000, # The sample is reset after this number of requests.
  minimum:          100,  # Degrade won&rsquo;t check whether the threshold has been hit until this number of requests has been made.
  threshold:        0.1,  # The error rate (in this case, 10%) to deactivate the service
  errors:           [StandardError], # The errors which will label this request as a failure
  failure_strategy: &ndash;> {  # A lambda to be called when the error rate is reached</p>

<pre><code>rollout.deactivate(:my_feature)
</code></pre>

<p>  }
)
```</p>

<p>Whoa, that&rsquo;s a lot of options!  Most pieces are optional and should be
fine-tuned to the needs of your application.  The important things are: you need
to pass in a <code>redis</code> object, give your degrade object a <code>name</code>, and feed it a
<code>failure_strategy</code> lambda which will run if the error threshold is reached.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s discuss how to use your shiny new degrade object!</p>

<h3>Wrap a call</h3>

<p>Your <code>degrade</code> object comes with a <code>#perform</code> method that takes a block, thusly:</p>

<p><code>ruby
data = degrade_my_feature.perform do
  Net::HTTP.get('mega-downtime.com', '/data.json')
end
</code></p>

<p>It will run the block without impacting the return value, only pausing to mark
whether the block raised one of the specified errors.  As you can see from
<a href="https://github.com/jamesgolick/degrade/blob/master/lib/degrade.rb#L12-L20">the source code</a> for <code>#perform</code>:</p>

<p>``` ruby
def perform
  begin</p>

<pre><code>mark_request
yield
</code></pre>

<p>  rescue *@errors => e</p>

<pre><code>mark_failure
raise e
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>It simply marks that a request is being made, and yields to your passed-in
block. If all goes well, <code>perform</code> will return the return value of the block.
If an error occurs, and it&rsquo;s one of the errors you&rsquo;ve selected to track, degrade
will rescue, mark that this request ended in failure, and re-raise the error.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s important to understand that degrade won&rsquo;t automatically turn off a feature
for you.  All it does is run the <code>failure_strategy</code> you&rsquo;ve given it.  You can
use something like rollout to handle the failure situation.  Here is an example:</p>

<p>``` ruby
if rollout.active?(:my_feature)
  data = degrade_my_feature.perform do</p>

<pre><code>Net::HTTP.get('mega-downtime.com', '/data.json')
</code></pre>

<p>  end
  hashify(data)
else
  {}
end
```</p>

<p>You can, of course, cut off the request earlier in your code.  You might turn
off a controller action entirely if the external service it needs is down.</p>

<h2>Customizing Your <code>failure_strategy</code></h2>

<p>The <code>failure_strategy</code> you pass to degrade is just a plain old lambda, so you
can pass in any code that you want.  Let&rsquo;s say you create an <code>OutageNotifier</code>
module which can send an email/text when the external service goes down.  Just
call that code from the <code>failure_strategy</code>.  You can also set up a Sidekiq
worker that will reactivate the service (i.e., try again) after a specified
period of time.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s how you might do all that in one <code>failure_strategy</code>:</p>

<p>```ruby
degrade_my_feature = Degrade.new(
  redis,
  name: :my_feature,
  failure_strategy: &ndash;> {</p>

<pre><code>rollout.deactivate(:my_feature)
OutageNotifier.notify(downtime: :my_feature)
MyFeatureActivatorWorker.perform_in(30.minutes)
</code></pre>

<p>  }
)
```</p>

<h3>Reactivation</h3>

<p>There is one catch to be aware of when reactivating.  Degrade does not
automatically reset the sample when it runs the <code>failure_strategy</code>.  It has a
private method to do that (after it hits the sample size max), but we&rsquo;ll respect
that method&rsquo;s privacy.  Here&rsquo;s what <a href="https://github.com/jamesgolick/degrade/blob/master/lib/degrade.rb#L56-L61">that method</a> looks
like:</p>

<p>```ruby
def reset_sample
  if requests > @sample</p>

<pre><code>@redis.del(requests_key)
@redis.del(failures_key)
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>If we <a href="https://github.com/jamesgolick/degrade/blob/master/lib/degrade.rb#L31-L37">dive deeper</a>, we&rsquo;ll see that <code>requests_key</code> and
<code>failures_key</code> are:</p>

<p>```ruby
def requests_key
  &ldquo;status:#{@name}:requests&rdquo;
end</p>

<p>def failures_key
  &ldquo;status:#{@name}:failures&rdquo;
end
```</p>

<p>So if we copy those methods, all we have to do to reset the sample is copy that
code into our worker.  Here&rsquo;s a simplified Sidekiq worker, where <code>#perform</code> will
reset the sample and then reactivate the feature flag:</p>

<p>```ruby
class MyFeatureActivatorWorker
  include Sidekiq::Worker</p>

<p>  def perform</p>

<pre><code>reset_sample
rollout.activate(:my_feature)
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  private</p>

<p>  def reset_sample</p>

<pre><code>redis.del(requests_key)
redis.del(failures_key)
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def requests_key</p>

<pre><code>"status:my_feature:requests"
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def failures_key</p>

<pre><code>"status:my_feature:failures"
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>Now you can use the line of code:
<code>ruby
MyFeatureActivatorWorker.perform_in(30.minutes)
</code>
to reactivate the feature after a 30-minute delay.  If you&rsquo;re really clever, you
can even set it up to increase the delay each time.  It all depends on the needs
of your application.</p>

theoretical background, see <a href="/blog/2015/01/18/feature-flags-in-ruby-part-i-what-and-why/">Part I</a>.</em></p>

<p>Alright, you&rsquo;re convinced that feature flags are a necessary tool for your app.
Let&rsquo;s discuss a gem, created by the late <a href="http://jamesgolick.com">James Golick</a>, which
make the process of feature flagging as simple as could be.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Rollout: A Feature Flagging Tool</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/FetLife/rollout">Rollout</a> is a super-simple gem for feature flagging. To get started,
you&rsquo;ll need a redis instance accessible to your app.  You likely have this in
place already.  If not, you can pass in a reference to any object that accepts
<code>set</code> and <code>get</code> methods.  But as redis is becoming a more and more common part
of the standard stack, you should probably just set up a redis instance.</p>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s get started.</p>

<h3>Install the gem</h3>

<p>First, you&rsquo;ll need to <code>gem install rollout</code> or add <code>gem "rollout"</code> to your
Gemfile and <code>bundle install</code>.</p>

<h3>Instantiate the <code>rollout</code> object</h3>

<p>Next, assuming you have a <code>redis</code> variable which is an instance of
<a href="https://github.com/redis/redis-rb">Redis</a>:</p>

<p><code>ruby
rollout = Rollout.new(redis)
</code></p>

<p>and you have your <code>rollout</code> object.  The <a href="https://github.com/redis/redis-rb">official docs</a>
recommend assigning it to a global variable (<code>$rollout</code>), but if you&rsquo;d rather
avoid that, you can assign a <code>rollout</code> variable at the global scope.  (In a
Rails app, this code would belong in an initializer.)</p>

<h3>Flipping Switches</h3>

<p>Now you get to become a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb9GREgzQYQ">switch-flipper</a>!  Turning a feature on
or off is as simple as:
``` ruby</p>

<h1>activate for all users</h1>

<p>rollout.activate(:chat)</p>

<h1>deactivate for all users</h1>

<p>rollout.deactivate(:chat)
```</p>

<p>The rollout object will always be able to tell you whether a feature is active:
<code>ruby
rollout.activate(:my_cool_feature)
rollout.active?(:my_cool_feature) #=&gt; true
rollout.deactivate(:my_cool_feature)
rollout.active?(:my_cool_feature) #=&gt; false
</code></p>

<h3>Partial Activation</h3>

<p>Sometimes you may want to activate a feature for a particular set of
users.  Let&rsquo;s say we want to grant our premium users access to the beta version
of our product.
``` ruby
rollout.define_group(:premium_users) { |user| user.premium? }
rollout.activate_group(:beta, :premium_users)</p>

<p>premium_user = User.where(premium: true).first
rollout.active?(:beta, premium_user) #=> true</p>

<p>regular_user = User.where(premium: false).first
rollout.active?(:beta, regular_user) #=> false
<code>``
Rollout knows that only</code>premium_users<code>, as defined by the block
</code>{ |user| user.premium? }<code>, have the</code>beta<code>feature active, and will return true
or false based on the user passed in to</code>#active?`.</p>

<p>Sometimes you may want to activate a feature for a random percentage of users.
Rollout can handle that too:</p>

<p><code>ruby
rollout.activate_percentage(:chat, 20)
</code></p>

<p>Now 20% of users will have chat activated.  Rollout also makes sure that it&rsquo;s
the same set of 20% of users who have chat available, so users don&rsquo;t have a
disjointed experience.</p>

<h3>Inserting Branch Points</h3>

<p>The trickiest part of using feature flags is figuring out where to branch your
code.  Ideally, the code should only need one call to <code>rollout#active?</code> to
invoke the correct behavior.</p>

<h4>Controller-Level Branch Points</h4>

<p>Sometimes, the simplest place to branch is in a controller.  Let&rsquo;s say we want
to feature-flag an entire endpoint in a Rails app:</p>

<p>```ruby
class ExperimentalController &lt; ApplicationController</p>

<p>  def index</p>

<pre><code>if rollout.active?(:my_feature)
  @entities = MyFeature.get_entities(params)
  respond_with @entities
else
  head(:service_unavailable)
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>end
```</p>

<p>If <code>my_feature</code> is active, the controller does its usual work of calling models
and views.  If <code>my_feature</code> is deactivated, the controller responds with a
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.5.4">503</a>.
This is a pretty clean example of an <a href="/blog/2015/01/18/feature-flags-in-ruby-part-i-what-and-why/#feature-flag-types">&ldquo;On/Off&rdquo; feature flag</a>.</p>

<p>This pattern is very useful for experimental API endpoints, as well as debugging
utilities which will often be inactive.  It is also a good place to halt
requests which, to succeed, will require a call to an external service that is
currently experiencing downtime.</p>

<h4>Model-Level Branch Points</h4>

<p>Sometimes we want our application to display fundamentally different behavior
depending on the situation.</p>

<p>In this sample scenario, we already have a GitHub API integration, and we&rsquo;re
trying out a BitBucket API integration as well.  When we fetch the user&rsquo;s repos,
we want to control at runtime whether we&rsquo;re just getting the GitHub repos or
also checking BitBucket.  Here&rsquo;s the code:</p>

<p>```ruby
class User
  # &hellip;</p>

<p>  def repos</p>

<pre><code>if rollout.active?(:bitbucket)
  github_repos + bitbucket_repos
else
  github_repos
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  # &hellip;
end
```</p>

<p>It might take hundreds of lines of code across multiple classes to fetch and
format those <code>bitbucket_repos</code> for the User, but we found one point in our code
where we can decide whether or not all that code gets executed.</p>

<h4>View/Decorator-Level Branch Points</h4>

<p>Placing feature-related conditionals in our views is (almost) always a bad
practice, so let&rsquo;s not address it here.  But we can sometimes make the case that
a decorator class is the right place for a feature flag.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s say that our API currently returns a top-level JSON Array, which is a
<a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/security/#json-security">Bad Practice™</a>.  We want to follow the Good Practice and return
a top-level JavaScript object.  But we realize that clients may not be ready to
handle that.  We can set up a feature flag to switch over to the new format once
our clients have had ample time to prepare:</p>

<p>```ruby
class ResponseFormatter</p>

<p>  attr_reader :array</p>

<p>  def initialize(array)</p>

<pre><code>@array = array
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def output</p>

<pre><code>if rollout.active?(:safe_json_format)
  { 'array' =&gt; array }
else
  array
end
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>end
```</p>

<p>This is a very clear example of a <a href="/blog/2015/01/18/feature-flags-in-ruby-part-i-what-and-why/#feature-flag-types">This/That feature flag</a>.</p>

<h2>Back to Flipping Switches</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;ve spoken about how to set up switches, and how to flip them in code.  How do
we flip the switches when our code is running live in production?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the rollout gem doesn&rsquo;t provide any sort of UI, and you basically
need to SSH into your production server and modify the value in redis.  In the
case of Rails, you would enter the Rails console, and execute the command
<code>rollout.activate(:my_feature)</code> or <code>rollout.deactivate(:my_feature)</code>.</p>

<p>Is there a better way?</p>

<h3>Improvement 1: Set Up an HTTP Endpoint</h3>

<p>If we&rsquo;re running web apps, we can always add endpoints!  This is how a Rails app
might handle feature flipping via HTTP requests:</p>

<p>``` ruby
class FeaturesController &lt; ApplicationController</p>

<p>  def update</p>

<pre><code>rollout.activate(params[:id].to_sym)
head :ok
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  def destroy</p>

<pre><code>rollout.deactivate(params[:id].to_sym)
head :ok
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>end</p>

<p>```</p>

<p>You probably want to have a <code>before_filter</code> to require authentication as well.</p>

<p>At any rate, this allows you to easily activate and deactivate features without
needing to SSH anywhere.</p>

<h3>Improvement 2: Use Hubot</h3>

<p>Hubot comes with a simple, powerful system for making HTTP requests.  Using this
system, you can set up Hubot to hit these endpoints when instructed via chat
command.  If you have a running Hubot instance, it&rsquo;s very simple to set up.
This is the code to activate a feature:</p>

<p>``` coffeescript
robot.respond /activate (\w+)$/i, (msg) &ndash;>
  feature = msg.match[1]</p>

<p>  msg.http(&ldquo;<a href="http://my-app.com/features/#">http://my-app.com/features/#</a>{feature}&rdquo;).put() &ndash;></p>

<pre><code>msg.reply "Activated #{feature}!"
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Now, when I say <code>hubot activate a_feature</code>, it takes care of it, then responds,
<code>Activated a_feature!</code>  Suddenly, managing feature flags becomes a breeze.</p>

<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;ve discovered how to use rollout to easily turn bits of code on and off in a
live application.  In <a href="/blog/2015/01/19/feature-flags-in-ruby-part-iii-who-automate-feature-flipping/">Part III</a>, we will discuss how to
automatically turn off feature flags when an external service experiences
downtime.</p>

<h2>What are Feature Flags?</h2>

<p>Glad you asked!</p>

<p>Feature flags, also known as &ldquo;feature flippers,&rdquo; &ldquo;feature toggles,&rdquo;
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_toggle">and more</a>, are a way to simply turn bits of code on and
off in a live, running application.</p>

<p>While we won&rsquo;t get into too many of the details in this post, here&rsquo;s a simple
way to think about it.  Let&rsquo;s say you run a bowling alley.  Most of the time,
it&rsquo;s a straightforward establishment &ndash; lanes, balls, scoring computers, shoes&hellip;
you get the idea.  However, every Tuesday night you turn over the place, and now
it&rsquo;s Cosmic Bowling night!  You&rsquo;re blasting music, shining blacklights, the
disco ball is spinning&hellip; it&rsquo;s a different world.  How are you going to carry
out this operation?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Theoretically, you could go around every week and change all the lightbulbs, set
up the disco ball, and hook up the speakers, and then undo it all afterwards.
But that setup is highly error-prone and labor-intensive!</p>

<p>Shockingly, programmers do this all the time.  Sometimes, real-world needs force
us to have 2 working versions of our code.  Maybe we need to be ready to respond
to 2 versions of an API &ndash; we&rsquo;ll get into examples shortly.  The way we deal with
this is often by maintaining two active branches of our code.  This means that
we end up having to make sure we&rsquo;re applying all new code and fixes to both
branches, which is a nightmare.  And what if they really diverge to the point
that patches are no longer simple?</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s worse, sometimes we need to go back and forth on code deployed to our
production servers.  Do we really want the stress of deploying code every time
we want a feature turned on or off?  Of course not!</p>

<p>Enter feature flags.</p>

<p>To implement a feature flag, you need 2 things.  First, you need a branch point
in your code where you can decide which direction your program will take.
Second, you need an external method of flipping the switch in one direction or
another.</p>

<p><a name="feature-flag-types"></a></p>

<h2>Types of Feature Flags</h2>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen it described this way anywhere, but I&rsquo;ve come up with the idea
that there are two major types of feature flags, which I&rsquo;ve named as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>On/Off</strong> &ndash; decide whether a feature should be active or inactive</li>
<li><strong>This/That</strong> &ndash; direct executing code down one of two paths</li>
</ol>


<p>Although they are implemented in nearly the same way, these two types differ
conceptually, and we will refer to them often as we continue our discussion.</p>

<h2>Why Feature Flags?</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s jump into some real-world scenarios to understand how feature flags might
be helpful.  I will list 5 types of situations, but there are certainly others,
and you may discover them in your own development work.</p>

<h3>Experimental Code</h3>

<p>Maybe you, or someone ordering you around, had a great idea about how to improve
your web app.  But not everyone is convinced that it&rsquo;s such a good idea, or
perhaps someone thinks it might break everything.  You&rsquo;d like to turn it on for
a bit and see what happens, with a low cost to deactivate the new code if
anything goes wrong.</p>

<p>Using feature flags, you can insert a branch point to decide whether to run the
old code or jump into your new feature.  Then, when the app is live in
production, you can turn on the feature, see what happens, and be able to
quickly deactivate the new code.</p>

<p>A/B testing also falls under this paradigm.  If you are considering a change to
your app and want some evidence about the user impact, you can turn it on,
gather evidence, and then turn it off again while you evaluate.  Or, using a
This/That feature flag, you can test two different implementations and decide
which is better.</p>

<h3>Syncing Apps in an SOA Ecosystem</h3>

<p>Your company has jumped on the SOA bandwagon, and your app is now broken up into
multiple services that talk to each other.  Now, you want to change the public
API of one service, which will impact the downstream clients that consume it.
Using feature flags, you can seamlessly transition from one API to the other.</p>

<p>The service being changed has to keep the old code and the new code, and use a
This/That feature flag to control which API version to expose.  The client, in
the meantime, also uses a feature flag to decide which API to consume.  When the
time comes, flip those two switches together, and your apps can communicate
using the new API.  (If you set up your architecture right, you can actually
have both switches really be one switch, which enforces change in unison.)</p>

<h3>Consuming Internal Services (Built by Other Teams)</h3>

<p>Although conceptually similar to the previous case, there is an enormous
practical difference.  Your company may have its product split up into services
maintained by separate teams.  In this case, you cannot control exactly when the
other team will change its service.</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s say you depend on Service X.  Team X tells you they are switching to a
new API in one month&rsquo;s time.  You want to start building against the new API,
to be ready for its deployment, but your code also has to be maintained in the
meantime.  Also, who says they will truly update their API in one month?  Maybe
things will be delayed, and it will be 6 months, during which time your
development progress is stymied by the fact that you can&rsquo;t deploy anything,
since you&rsquo;ve built in support for the new API and thereby lost support for the
old!</p>

<p>Feature flags provide a convenient way to handle this issue.  You can build into
your code the ability to access the new API, but keep it inactive using a
feature flag.  Once the new API is in place, flip the switch!</p>

<h3>External Services</h3>

<p>Sometimes websites get DoS'ed.  Or DDoS'ed.  Or just a developer did something
dumb and crashed the app for 10 minutes.  Lots of things can happen, and if you
depend on an external service, their downtime can be yours as well.</p>

<p>Luckily, there is a way out.  You can establish a strategy for what to do when
the external service is inaccessible.  Normally, that strategy is kept inactive
using a feature flag.  If the service experiences downtime, toggle the flag and
you can activate your strategy for circumventing the service.  Even better, you
don&rsquo;t have to do it yourself; a <a href="/blog/2015/01/19/feature-flags-in-ruby-part-iii-who-automate-feature-flipping/">later post</a> will show
you how to activate this strategy programmatically.</p>

<p>Less downtime means happier customers means fun and profit!</p>

<h3>Debugging Tools</h3>

<p>At <a href="http://vitals.com">Vitals</a>, we have a number of tools we use to log extra information
about the state of our application and the data it processes, for debugging
purposes.  However, these tools come at a price: they add a small amount of
extra latency to each request.  We only want to activate these debugging tools
as necessary for debugging, and the simplest way to do that is to associate them
with feature flags.  Feature flag on&mdash;do extra work.  Feature flag off&mdash;speed
up the request.</p>

<p>Additionally, depending on the situation, debugging tools may occasionally yield
output in the HTTP responses sent to the client.  This may be necessary to
invoke on occasion, but certainly should not be active as a default.  It might
expose too much information to users, and certainly should not be active by
default.  Perhaps you want to have this information available as a matter of
course in your QA/UAT/staging environment, and in case of emergency in
production.  In any of these cases, feature flags provide convenient,
finely-tuned control over these sensitive parts of your application.</p>

<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>

<p>At this point, we have a better understanding of what feature flags are, and why
we might want them in our application.  In <a href="/blog/2015/01/18/feature-flags-in-ruby-part-ii-how-and-where/">Part II</a>, we
will give practical examples of how to set up feature flags, and where to place
them in our code.</p>
