#### Talk Description:
OpenStruct, part of Rubyâ€™s standard library, is prized for its beautiful API. It provides dynamic data objects with automatically generated getters and setters. Unfortunately, OpenStruct also carries a hefty performance penalty.

Recently, Rubyists have tried various approaches to speed up OpenStruct or provide alternatives. We will study these attempts, learning how to take advantage of the tools in our ecosystem while advancing the state of the Ruby community.

Sometimes, we can have our cake and eat it too. But it takes creativity, hard work, and willingness to question why things are the way they are.
