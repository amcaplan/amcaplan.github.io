#### Talk Description:
Every society has its own stories, which draw on the specific characteristics of
that group of people and speak to their emotional underpinnings. We might not
even notice it in our own surroundings, but it becomes quite apparent when
studying the literature of other cultures.

In that vein, we'll examine several Israeli children's classics, seeing how they
reflect the unique history and culture of the country. Reflecting upon that
example, we'll think about what aspects of the Ruby community are reflected in
the stories we tell the next generation, and which missing stories need to be told.
