#### Talk Description:
You care deeply about code quality and constantly strive to learn more. You
devour books and blogs, watch conference talks, and practice code katas.

That's excellent! But immaculately factored code and clean architecture alone
won't guarantee quality software.

As a developer, your job isn't to write Good Code. It's to deliver value for
people. In that light, we'll examine the effects of a host of popular coding
practices. What do they accomplish? Where do they fall short?

We'll set meaningful goals for well-rounded, high-quality software that solves
important problems for real people.
