#### Talk Description:
Ugh, documentation.

It's the afterthought of every system, scrambled together in the final days
before launch, updated sparingly, generally out of date.

What if we could programmatically verify that our API documentation was
accurate? What if this helped us build more intuitive APIs by putting our users
first? What if documentation came first, and helped us write our code?

With Swagger and Apivore as our weapons of choice, we'll write documentation
that will make your APIs better, your clients more satisfied, and you happier.
