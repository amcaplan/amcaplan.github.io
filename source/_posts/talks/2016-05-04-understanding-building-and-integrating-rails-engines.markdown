This workshop was given at RailsConf 2016.  The conference did not record workshops, so there's no video (though I intend to record one), but in the meantime, here are slides:

#### Talk Description:
Want to split up your Rails app into pieces but not sure where to begin? Wish you could share controller code among microservices but don't know how? Do you work on lots of projects and have boilerplate Rails code repeated in each?

Rails Engines may be your answer.

By building a simple Rails engine together, we will better understand how this app-within-an-app architecture can help you write more modular code, which can be gemified and reused across multiple projects.
