  description: Recruiting programmers isn't hard - just advertise what we
    actually want. Oh, and be what you say, too.
---

I've read a lot recently about how hard it is to recruit programmers in today's
market.  Personally, I think it's all hogwash.

There are plenty of great programmers out there, but companies aren't actually
looking for them.  What they really want is a plug-n-play solution, a programmer
who knows what they need him/her to know, who can churn out code and build
software solutions.

The problem is that engineering is an art and a discipline, and you can't just
expect to hire someone and have them show up batteries included.  A company that
refuses to train its coders is a company that won't find enough people to meet
its needs.

## What Not To Do

Recently, I saw an ad for a job that required, among other things:

1. 5+ years experience
2. A college degree (no "or equivalent training and experience")
3. Being comfortable with the Microsoft stack, Java, Angular, and Node
4. Knowledge of data privacy practices and laws
5. Understanding of SSO and SAML
6. Project management experience
7. Experience in the healthcare technology industry

In other words, the ad was for a college-educated senior front-end/back-end
developer, security expert, and project manager with healthcare tech experience,
all rolled into one.

The "Accountabilities and Activities" section was equally incoherent,
essentially requiring involvement with every part of the stack, from end-users
to business plans to documentation to configuration to application architecture.
(Interestingly, out of 11 bullet points, only one indirectly mentioned coding at
all: "Develop new or modify existing applications and systems as required.")

I could tolerate advertising for a generalist, even though that's already a
unicorn.  But what really bothers me is the list of requirements.  That list
severely narrows the already-tiny population that would be relevant to the job,
for no good reason.  In fact, it narrows it for a very bad reason: The company
is simply unwilling to train new hires.  Any programmer it picks up must be
plug-n-play, no instructions necessary.

I have no idea whether that job ad picked up anyone, but I'm 99% certain that if
it did, it was someone who had no more than 3-4 of the points I mentioned.
Because the unicorn they're seeking just doesn't exist, but overconfident people
certainly do.

## What To Do?

If you're interested in opening up your application pool to people who are worth
hiring, people who will be great to work with, and maybe don't have 100% of the
skills you need, try toning down your job ads.  Limit requirements to the
absolute minimum you can imagine.

But there's more than that.  Think of it as a sales pitch.  You don't sell a
product by saying, "Look at how much money you'll get to pay for it!  And did we
mention that tax is not even included in the price?"  You sell
a product on its features.  "Look at what this product can do!  It will
revolutionize your lifestyle!"

Most job ads sell the job as "Here's what _we_, the company, want you to do, and
this is what _we_ think you need to do it."  Maybe think about it from the job
seeker's perspective for a change.  Why should I, as a programmer in high
demand, focus the majority of my waking hours on building your product?  What's
my motivation?  What can you do to help me build my career?  Will your company
give me the time to actually enjoy the salary you're paying me?

I wrote a sample job ad for a made-up company, to demonstrate the sort of perks
that might appeal to software developers.  Some might even appeal to
business-oriented folks as well.  (I've erred on the side of having this run too
long, since I hope companies will be able to use this as a brainstorming
example.  Your actual job ad should be way shorter than this.)

> Do you care about teamwork, learning, and professional development?  Want to
work with a smart, diverse group, solving complex problems?  Do you feel
satisfaction from writing clean code with excellent test coverage?  Do you enjoy
even more when a teammate shows you how to improve your code?

> If you answered "yes" to those questions, SawftWearLy would love to chat with
you.  We've built a professional environment where we constantly iterate on our
practices, both human and technical.

> At SawftWearLy, we seek to create value above all, so we're less nitpicky
about the where and when of how you work.  We do believe, though, that pair
programming and code review are building blocks of better code and professional
development, so we'll ask you to make sure your hours are conducive to
teamwork.

> We understand that it's easier to build great developers than to recruit them,
so we won't demand X years of experience in Y.  We're looking for devs who are
bright and eager to learn, and we'll provide the support that we can to help you
be awesome.  We maintain a library of hard-copy and Kindle books, and we'll
get you a CodeSchool or PluralSight subscription if you'd like.  Our engineers
attend and speak at conferences and local meetups.  We also arrange frequent
internal presentations where developers can speak about anything related to
coding.  We contribute to open source, even during work hours.

> SawftWearLy tries to create an enjoyable, dynamic work atmosphere, but we know
your work isn't your whole life.  We want to minimize the tension between work
and your other priorities. To make sure you feel comfortable taking time off and
relaxing, we have a minimum/maximum PTO policy, so everyone needs to take a
vacation, and you know how much is too much.

> Rather than beer kegs or ping-pong tables, we've decided to invest in your
future with a partial matching 401(k) plan.  We have top-notch health and life
insurance options, so you'll have peace of mind knowing that you and your loved
ones are covered.

> Compensation is standardized per job category, so you will know you're getting
fairly compensated.  However, we do award bonuses based on performance, so we
can recognize employees who display initiative and creativity in their work.

> SawftWearLy is a workplace where managers speak to their team members to make
sure they have the support they need.  It's a collaborative space where we make
time to talk about what we can do better, or just bounce ideas off each other.
We celebrate questions, and value answers that convey not just information, but
understanding.

> If SawftWearLy sounds like a good fit for you, drop us a line at
dev@sawftwear.ly.  Tell us about something you've built, what you're learning
now, and something you like doing outside of programming.

Note that there weren't really any requirements here.  That's because you don't
actually need a coder who's familiar with your technical stack, or your business
domain.  They'll figure it out in a couple months.  (Would you rather spend 2-3
months training a new hire, or wasting your efforts on continued attempts to
find someone who knows it all already?)  But you need people who are smart and
motivated, and who know how to program well.  And you need to keep them happy,
because there are plenty of other companies out there.

## The Catch

Some of you might be thinking, "That sounds great, but we don't actually do that
at our company!"  Well, guess what?  That's exactly the point.

If you want awesome developers to work for you, you need to be an awesome place
for developers to work at.  It's impossible, without lying outright, to have an
awesome job ad without being an awesome workplace.

So the actual secret to hiring great developers is to treat the ones you have
really well, and let your job ads reflect that.  Really, we don't demand much -
give us learning opportunities and good people to work with, and chill out if we
want to work from 11AM to 7PM, or 7AM to 3PM, or work from home 3 days a week.

On my team, I've been a major evangelist for pair programming, I've been very
involved with training newer folks, and I do it across an ocean at +7 hours.
Especially in this field, it's so important to be open to creative solutions for
getting good people to work together, because good people are hard to come by.
