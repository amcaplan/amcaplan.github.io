Ariel has been hacking since he was 10 years old, building websites to promote publications and make fun of teachers.  In late 2013, after a brief stint in bio research, he made the switch to full-time programming.  With lots of help from the Flatiron School in NYC, Ariel learned Ruby, Rails, and JavaScript, and is now getting paid to keep learning.

Ariel currently works as a software engineer at [Vitals](http://vitals.com).
